hxDaedalus flixel examples  
  
## Demos  
- [Basic](https://hxdaedalus.github.io/hxDaedalus-flixel/FlxDaedalus/exportBasic/html5/bin/index.html)
- [Maze](https://hxdaedalus.github.io/hxDaedalus-flixel/FlxDaedalus/exportMaze/html5/bin/index.html)
- [Finding](https://hxdaedalus.github.io/hxDaedalus-flixel/FlxDaedalus/exportFinding/html5/bin/index.html)
  
## Note:  
to switch versions when compiling just change the enum used in the Main class. 
```
var currentDemo = MAZE;
```

Compared to other toolkit solutions this currently seems heavy to render, open to improvements and pull requests.
